# Final Year Project-
Advanced sparsely supported hardware matrix multiplication-

This project focuses on optimizing matrix multiplication operations by leveraging sparsity in matrices and specialized hardware support. Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in many fields, including machine learning, scientific computing, and graphics. However, traditional matrix multiplication can be inefficient, especially when dealing with sparse matrices â€” matrices where a large number of elements are zero.

Key Highlights:
Sparsity-Aware Optimization: This project implements advanced algorithms that efficiently handle sparsely populated matrices. By skipping unnecessary multiplications involving zero elements, the computation is significantly accelerated, particularly for large matrices.

Hardware Acceleration: The project integrates with hardware architectures that are designed or optimized for matrix operations (e.g., FPGAs, GPUs, TPUs). These hardware components exploit parallelism and minimize memory overhead, leading to faster and more energy-efficient computations.

Flexible Data Structures: The implementation uses specialized data structures, such as Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) or Coordinate List (COO) formats, to represent sparse matrices, allowing for quick access to non-zero elements and minimizing memory footprint.
